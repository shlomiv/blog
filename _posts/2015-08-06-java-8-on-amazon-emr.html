excerpt: a bootstrap action for amazon EMR that installs java 8
---
<p>
Recently I needed to use a library requiring java 8 on a large hadoop
cluster running on Amazon EMR. I couldn't find any AMI's that has it
installed. After some searching around, I found the gollowing <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericeijkelenboom/9951500">emr
bootstrap on gist</a>, which is a yum based solution. Since I use debian
based ami, I modified it slightly, as shown below.
</p>

<p>
On emr ami, some applications uses java 7, while others uses
java 6. In order to not mess things up, we would like that only our
hadoop job will use java 8. To get that we need to set up <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
in the right context, which is to place it under
<code>/home/hadoop/conf/hadoop-user-env.sh</code>.
</p>

<p>
In order to use this bootstrap action, simply paste this file
somewhere on your s3 bucket, and make sure to register the full s3 url
of this file as a bootsrap action to your cluster.
