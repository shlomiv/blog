excerpt: How to add add-apt-repository without the need to install any packages
---
<p>
add-apt-repository is quite a useful command these days. However, for some reason it is not often straight forward to
install it. It has changed packages, has different package names for different distros, and in general its usually an
unneeded hassle. Thanks to a <a href="https://blog.anantshri.info/howto-add-ppa-in-debian/">an old blog post</a> by Anant Shrivastava, this could be as simple as <code>wget</code> 'ting that file!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">In terminal, simply do:</label>
<pre class="src src-sh">wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies <span class="org-string">"https://blog.anantshri.info/content/uploads/2010/09/add-apt-repository.sh.txt"</span>  -O add-apt-repository.sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So for example, say you want to install the lovely emacs 24 from a package, you could simply do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">sudo sh add-apt-repository.sh ppa:cassou/emacs
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs24
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And all should be set!
