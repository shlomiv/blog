add-apt-repository is quite a useful command these days, however, for some reason it is not often straight forward to
install it. It has changed packages, has different package names for different distros, and in general its usually an
unneeded hassle. Thanks to a [[https://blog.anantshri.info/content/uploads/2010/09/add-apt-repository.sh.txt][an old blog post]] by Anant Shrivastava, this could be as simple as =wget=ting that file!

#+Caption: In terminal, simply do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies "https://blog.anantshri.info/content/uploads/2010/09/add-apt-repository.sh.txt"  -O add-apt-repository.sh
#+END_SRC

So for example, say you want to install the lovely emacs 24 from a package, you could simply do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo sh add-apt-repository.sh ppa:cassou/emacs
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install emacs24
#+END_SRC

And all should be set!
